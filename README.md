# Portfolio for a friend interior designer
This was done to help a friend kickstart her career as an interior designer. The website is published on Vercel and can be visited at the following link :
https://portfolio-annaleduc.vercel.app/

The portfolio section is not completed since she's decided to build her own website using Wix. This was mostly done to show her what kind of platform I could build for her.

The website was fully developed using Angular, TypeScript and Bootsrap.
